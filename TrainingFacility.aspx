             Students get to know about the operating principles, the construction, the application and installation procedures of various
             automation control elements such as Single acting cylinder, Double acting cylinder, Single and Double sided pneumatic actuated 
            valves, Dual pressure valve, Shuttle valves, Quick exhaust valves, Single solenoid valves, Proximity reed switch, Pressure sensor, 
            Flow control valve, Proportional pressure regulator etc. By the  use of interface software to measure and control pneumatics  elements
             the students will learn to acquire fast PC supported recordings, experience to measure and interpret circuit status and infer the 
            system behavior.

        <div class="panel-body">Sensors are industrial devices that interact with the physical machinery or moving parts or environment around them and convert physical parameters or changes in parameters accurately into information that is made available on ‘real-time’ basis, to the rest of the control system it is connected with. A variety of industrial sensors used for object detection, position detection, speed detection are offered along with status indicating lamps and counters.  
o	This setup is configured with industrial grade automation devices.  Students get to know about the operating principles, 
            the physics, the applications, installation and tuning procedures of various sensing devices such as Inductive sensors, 
            Capacitive sensors, Photoelectric sensors ( with Direct detection, ER, Retro-reflective, Background Suppression options), 
            Magnetic sensors, Ultrasonic sensors , Color Contrast sensors, Distance Measurement and Positioning sensors, Incremental Rotary 
            Encoder, Speed / Frequency indicators, etc.
